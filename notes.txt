FK creation should be in 2 steps
- Add invalid FK with short timeouts
- Validate FK concurrently with long timeouts
FKs should always be named
Indexes should always be named
Indexes should always be btrees
Index creation should be concurrent and isolated, with large lock/statement timeout
Index creation should not occur in a transaction
Every other DDL change should occur in a transaction
New columns must always specify NULL
New columns must never specify a default (really?)
